## VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Judging

### Engineering Notebook Judge’s Evaluation Instructions

One of the VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Competition’s main missions is to help SECME student teams acquire real-world life skills to benefit them in their academic and professional future. The Engineering Notebook is a way for student teams to document the engineering design process during the VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Competition. The engineering notebook gives student teams the practice of essential life skills, including project management, time management, brainstorming, and teamwork. The engineering notebook reflects the documentation of the student team’s design decisions and efforts in creating a novel and innovative competitive robot. SECME student teams should start their engineering notebooks early and update them often and daily. Write handwritten notes and documentation neatly and clearly for judges to read without difficulty. 

Engineering is an iterative process requiring students to recognize and define a problem, brainstorm, and work through various stages of the design process, test their designs, improve their designs, and continue the process until a solution has been produced. During this process, students will come across obstacles, encounter successes and failures, and learn many lessons. It is this process that students should document in their Engineering Notebook. 

The engineering notebook is an opportunity to document everything a SECME student team does and serve as a historical guide of lessons learned and best practices that can benefit the SECME student team in future years. SECME students may document any number of things in their engineering notebooks. For example, team meeting notes, design concepts and sketches, pictures, notes from competitions, biographies of the members of their team (students, teachers, Coordinators, and mentors), observations and thoughts of team members throughout the season, team organization practices, and any other notes that a team finds useful.

#### Requirements
1. Cover page
    a. Title of the Engineering Notebook – Example: SECME Engineering Design Competition: VEX V5 or VEX IQ Robotics Engineering Notebook
    b. SECME Team Name
    c. Each SECME student team member’s name, grade
    d. Official School System/District Name
    e. SECME team’s official school name, city, state, and zip
    f. SECME School Coordinator’s (or Teacher’s) name and email

2. Table of Contents

3. Provide a brief description of each SECME team member and their strengths and benefits

4. Design ideas

5. SECME Team meeting notes (daily entries)

6. Construction of the robot

7. Operation 
    a. Describe how the robot has been designed to achieve the object of the VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics game and general novel features

8. Problems encountered and methods to resolve them

9. Conclusion/Future Recommendations

## The Art of Engineering 

### Judge’s Evaluation Instructions

This competition component showcases the ART in the SECME student team engineering design of their vehicle.

Each middle/high school division Mousetrap Car, Water Bottle Rocket, VEX IQ Robotics, and VEX V5 Robotics SECME student team will submit a five to seven-minute video on their car, rocket, or robot from the creative, innovative, and artistic perspective. In other words, sell your car’s, rocket’s, or robot’s capabilities creatively and informally. Every SECME student teammate must contribute to the team to get all possible points. Your video should introduce your SECME student teammates and display your technical drawing and vehicle. 

**The Art of Engineering will be judged on the following criteria**:

## Essay/Vision Board

### Judge’s Evaluation Instructions

#### Introduction

What is the Essay/Vision Board competition? SECME’s essay/vision board competition is a written and illustrative representation (vision board) on any of the three topics listed below. ALL essay/vision board submissions will require a cover page.

1. How has participation in SECME helped me to discover my STEM dream job?

2. How has the COVID-19 pandemic shown the importance of STEM?

3. Environmental issues
    a. Forest Fires
    b. Global Warming
    
Topics are open to all grade levels; however, some topics may require more critical thinking, explanations, and details, depending on the grade level. When choosing topics 2 or 3, answer the questions: (1) How does or how should STEM impact these global or environmental issues? (2) How do you see yourself contributing to the solution to these global or environmental issues? We encourage you to use your imagination.

#### Competition Requirements
Follow all instructions. Each essay and vision board entry must be prepared and submitted by an individual SECME student. When choosing topics 2 or 3, address: (1) How does or how should STEM impact these global or environmental issues? (2) How do you see yourself contributing to the solution of these global or environmental issues? We encourage you to use your imagination.

The vision board can be developed by hand or by using a computer program. For boards created by hand, teams can use materials such as magazine clippings, newspaper clippings, crayons, markers, colored pencils, colored pens, or paint. Clip art or electronic visual graphics are allowed when designing on a computer. Your vision board must be one page, and it can either be positioned in portrait or landscape.

**Grades Pre-K – 2**

Choose a topic. Create your vision board on paper. Next, working with your SECME Coordinator or parent/guardian, record a four-minute maximum video message explaining your vision board and how participation in SECME has helped you to choose that career path.

**Submission of your vision board must include the following**:
1.	Required cover page
2. Vision Board drawing is one page in length and can be positioned either in portrait or landscape
3. Four-minute (max) video explaining your vision board

**The vision board and video will be judged on the following criteria:**

* Includes required cover page, vision board 
*	Paper size Requirements
*	Appearance/Effort

**Grades 3 – 5**

Choose a topic. Write your essay and visually depict your essay by creating a vision board on paper. 

**Submission of the essay/vision board must include the following**:

1. Required cover page
2. The essay should contain 500 – 1,000 words
3. Write a one-paragraph description of your vision board (the description should be included in your essay and not on the vision board page)
4. Vision Board drawing is one page long and can be positioned either in portrait or landscape
5.	Four-minute (max) video explaining your vision board (optional)

**The essay will be judged on the following criteria**:
