# Letter to our Competition Hosts

Dear SECME Educators and Competition Hosts:

The SECME National Office is excited to welcome you to the 2022-2023 SECME Competition year. *This year’s competition theme is based on your school or Informal STEM Learning Environment (ISL) mascot or school motto.* This document contains information for the SECME National Student Engineering Design Competition Guidelines, generally known as the *“SECME National Guidelines.”* The Middle/High Division of the 2023 SECME National Student Engineering Design Competition Finals will be held in-person except for the water bottle rocket and essay/vison board competition, which are non-travelling competitions.

SECME competitions are a fantastic way for teachers to reinforce science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills with exciting, engaging hands-on activities while challenging students to persevere and excel. SECME student competitions expose students to real-world applications in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics while generating interest and excitement about college and careers in STEM.

To our SECME Competition Hosts, in addition to hosting your SECME competition, in years past, many of you have provided technical assistance to schools and districts by way of SECME workshops for teachers to learn basic and necessary SECME competition skills to assist SECME students. The ability to provide these services continues to reside in this evolving new atmosphere. The SECME National Office is preparing to support by developing complementary competition training videos for all 2022-2023 registered schools.

To make this year’s competition fun and challenging, we added new engineering and artistic twists and turns to stir our future scientists’, engineers’, technologists,’ and mathematicians’ minds. Activities, deadlines, and SECME competitions at the local, district, state, and regional levels are at the discretion of the SECME Member University or Competition Host. We encourage participation at all levels and divisions (elementary, middle, and high school).

Thank you for your partnership and commitment to equity and excellence in STEM education. Have a wonderful and safe school year!


Sincerely,

Dr. Julaunica Tigner

Educational Outreach Manager

<small> We welcome any corrections or any suggestions for improvement to our SECME National Guidelines. The feedback and comments we receive via email or telephone calls have supported the preparation of our annual guidelines. To provide feedback, please email julaunicatigner@ufl.edu </small>

# SECME National Competition Guidelines

## Mouse Trap Car (MTC)

<center>
![](images_MSHS/MTC_1.png){width=50%}
</center>

### All Divisions - Construction and Operation

Any team not adhering to the construction and operation guidelines will not be eligible to place.

#### Construction and Design Requirements

1.	**A standard mousetrap** with dimensions of: length of 9.8 cm, width of 4.5 cm, and weight about 25 grams, **MUST** be used to construct the mousetrap car. **NO PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, MECHANICAL, OR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE MOUSETRAP IS PERMITTED.**

2.	Standard mousetraps with **ONE SPRING are ALLOWED**.

3.	The components of the mousetrap are a **wooden base. The other parts are mounted on the base: spring, bail, locking lever, and bait hook**. See [Standard Mousetrap Diagram].

4.	The mousetrap’s “single” spring must be the sole source of power. You may **NOT** provide extra power to your car by using rubber bands, CO2 boosters, rollback wheels/gears, or other agents or elements.

5.	In the car’s design and construction, the original mousetrap spring and wood base **MUST** remain intact. These two components may **NOT** be cut or altered in any way — mechanically, physically, chemically, or thermally. Only the locking lever and bait holder (and the staples that hold them on) may be removed from the base if desired. Teams may straighten the bail from its original bent configuration. It must remain a part of the completed car. 

6.	The spring must be visible and accessible to the judges for inspection.

7.	The mousetrap car must have a **minimum of three wheels** and can be as long or short as desired if it meets **requirement #5** above.

8.	Mousetrap cars are tested on a smooth flat surface. Distance will be measured from the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point of travel, utilizing a straight line to connect the two points *(total displacement, not the path traveled)*.

9.	There will be two runs for each car. The best run is used for the final scoring of the mousetrap car’s performance. 

10.	The mousetrap car should reflect this year’s efforts by your SECME student teams. During SECME Competition, **ONLY** the SECME students on the same SECME student team can adjust or make alterations to their mousetrap car.

    a.	If anyone other than the student teams is seen adjusting the mousetrap car, or         there is evidence, the team will be disqualified and unable to compete.
    
    b.	This includes but is not limited to SECME Coordinators/Coaches, Parents, etc.

11.	Evidence of plagiarism or re-submission of previous years’ reports will result in a zero score.

The design requirement of this year’s SECME engineering design competition is for the SECME student team to design and build a vehicle solely powered by a single spring mousetrap with a maximum budget of $2.50 that can swiftly transport (or carry) a tennis ball with approximate weights and diameters of 57.7 grams and 66.9 mm (0.64 inches).

**The mousetrap car**

*	Needs to carry a tennis ball with a weight of approximately 57.7 grams and a diameter of about 66.9 mm (0.64 inches)

*	May NOT have glue, tape, or anything to affix the tennis ball to the mousetrap car

*	May NOT wedge the tennis ball between the bait hook and the spring

*	Should be designed to allow for the purposeful removal of the tennis ball with minimal effort so that the Judge can examine it

*	Should transport the tennis ball (without losing it for the entire run)

*	Should not exceed a budget of $2.50 in building materials (maximum budget)

Original receipts for all materials purchased must be included* (scanned) AND recorded on the SECME Mousetrap Car Material List. 
* *If receipts are unavailable for new (not recycled) items, a link to the purchase website is sufficient to confirm the item cost.*

*	Do NOT include the cost of the basic mousetrap in your materials list

*	If using recycled materials, documentation must show how these items were obtained

*	Recycled materials are not included in the $2.50 maximum budget

**The tennis ball must remain in the mousetrap vehicle for the entire run of the mousetrap car to receive a qualifying score. A run is disqualified if the tennis ball falls out of the car.** If the tennis ball is dislodged due to a collision with an obstacle, the run is not disqualified. The run distance is measured to the point of collision - the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point or the point of collision.

**A standard-size tennis ball with a diameter of 66.9 mm (0.64 inches) and 40 g will be given to the SECME student teams on the day of competition before their run at the SECME National Student Competition Finals.**

~The Mousetrap Car Materials List is required for the Technical Report Appendix for middle/high school teams and the Written Report for elementary school teams. If the Materials List is NOT submitted, the Cost (C) for the team’s score is double the highest cost (C~H~) in the competition formula.

#### Measurement of L, the Mouse Car’s Longest Dimension
The length L is the longest dimension in the x, y, or z-axis. In other words, it could be the length, width, or height of the completed mousetrap car, which is the longest dimension.

<center>
![](images_MSHS/MTC2.jpg){width=50%}
</center>

The mousetrap car’s **length L is the longest dimension in the car’s x, y, or z-axis** while the car is resting with the spring unwound. In other words, it could be the length, width, or height of the completed mousetrap car, which is the longest dimension. If the bail has been straightened and protrudes past the front or rear of the car, the measurement is taken from the end of the bail to the other end of the car. 
**L (for this example) = 16.4 cm**

$\color{red}{\text{NOTE: The red parts may be removed from the car.}}$

### Middle School Division - Construction and Operation

The MTC Engineering Design Competition Middle School Division requires participation in these five areas:

1.	Mousetrap Car Performance Run
2.	Technical Report of Mousetrap Car 
3.	Technical Design Drawing of Mousetrap Car 
4.	PowerPoint Presentation on the Mousetrap Car
5.	The Art of Engineering video presentation


#### In-Person Event - Calculation of MTC Score

The performance score for the Mousetrap car run is calculated using the following equation:

<center>
$P =\frac{w}{W} × \frac{D}{L} × \frac{D}{T} × \frac{C_H}{C}$
</center>

Where:

w is the combined mass of a tennis ball and standard mousetrap (g). w = 25g + 57.7g = 82.7g

W is the total weight of the completed mousetrap car (g).

D is the distance the mousetrap car travels measured in centimeters (cm).

L is the longest length of the completed mousetrap car from any orientation on the x, y, and z-axis measured in centimeters (cm).

T is time measured from when the mousetrap car is released until the car has stopped, measured in seconds (s). 

C^+^ is the cost of the construction of the completed mousetrap car (based on the team’s MTC Materials List).*

C~H~ is a constant 2.5 (the highest possible cost). Therefore, C~H~=$2.50 in the equation.

P is the mousetrap car performance run score.

<center>
$F = \frac{P}{P_H} ×100%$
</center>

where:

P~H~ is the highest performance mousetrap car score on the day of the SECME Competition. 

F is the final performance score to be combined with the score from the Written Report.

Distance is measured from the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point of travel, utilizing a straight line to connect the two points.

<mark> The Mousetrap Car **MUST travel a MINIMUM distance of 5 m (500 cm)** to qualify for the competition. </mark>

Suppose the mousetrap car stops due to hitting an object or wall. The distance is measured from the starting point to the point of impact.

<small> *If the MTC Materials List is NOT submitted, the Cost (C) for the team’s score is calculated as double the highest cost (C~H~) in the competition formula.*</small>

<small> *If the value of C is $0.00 (meaning that except for the mousetrap, your car is built entirely with recycled materials), then use $0.01 (one penny) for the value of C. Therefore, C=0.01 in the equation.*</small>


##### Example Calculation

<center>
$C=0.01$  $C_H=2.50$ 

C, C~H~ are in USD ($) amounts

$D=950 cm$ $T=9.50 s$ $L=30 cm$ $w=82.7 g$ $W=182.7 g$

$P=\frac{w}{W} × \frac{D}{L}×\frac{D}{T}×\frac{C_H}{C}=\frac{82.7g}{182.7g}×\frac{950cm}{30cm}×\frac{950cm}{9.50s}×\frac{(2.50)}{(0.01)}=3.58×10^5$
</center>

The Final Score is based on the following criteria* at the National Competition.

*	Performance Score 20%

</center>


### All Divisions - Construction and Operation

While promoting Space Propulsion Awareness, the Water Bottle Rocket Competition helps familiarize students with rocketry, design engineering, and manufacturing engineering principles. SECME students will **design and manufacture** a water bottle rocket using a two-liter bottle as the pressure vessel. Given specific launch criteria, the rocket must launch from the Water Bottle Rocket Launcher. Additionally, each SECME team will create a patch design, written or technical report, PowerPoint presentation (middle/high school division), and technical drawing.

We have added two new features for this competition year.

1.	All divisions must complete and submit the WBR calculation exercises. These exercises are included in the written/technical report

2.	Water Bottle Rocket (middle/high school) teams will now compete in the Art of Engineering competition segment. Teams must submit the AOE video presentation

Calculation Exercises:

**Grades 6-8**

<center><mark>**NOTE: No forward-swept types of fins are allowed to be used on the rocket.**</mark></center>

7.	The bottle’s maximum fin width distance is 10 cm (or 16.5 cm from the center of the bottle axis). See [Diagram 3: Fin Diagram].

8.	Parachutes are NOT allowed to be used.

### Middle/High School Division - Construction and Operation

#### In-Person Event - Calculation of WBR Score 

<center><mark>**NOTE: Each entry must pass a visual inspection and height requirement to be eligible to compete. Entries that fail inspection are given ONE opportunity to make modifications to pass inspection before the beginning of the water bottle rocket competition.**</mark></center>

* Each SECME student team is required to submit a completed entry form, technical paper, and patch design. 
    + Check with your SECME Competition Host for local submission deadlines

* Before the launch, an operating rocket, technical drawing, and patch design must be submitted to compete on the day of the competition. 

An overall winner is determined by the following criteria (based on 100 pts):

*	Final Hang Time of Rocket 20%

*	Patch Design 20%

*	Technical Report 20%

*	Technical Drawing 20%

*	PowerPoint Presentation 20%


**Final Hangtime Score Calculation**

<center> 
$Final Hangtime Score=\frac{Hangtime}{Max Hangtime}x100%$ 
</center>

**Hangtime** is the time from when the rocket leaves the launch pad until it (or any part of it) reaches the ground or strikes an object. This measurement will be taken using a stopwatch by two or three (2-3) qualified judges. The average of the judges’ times will be used as the team’s hangtime.

**Max Hangtime** is the maximum hang time recorded during the SECME Competition.

The contest’s objective is for each SECME student team to launch a rocket-propelled by water and air and for it to stay aloft for the maximum amount of time (measured in seconds). The launch angle, which can be adjusted from approximately **90 degrees (90^o^)**, will be kept the **SAME** for all rockets launching during a particular competition. Each rocket will be launched using **12 oz water** at **70 psi of air pressure**.

NOTE: The maximum final middle/high school Water Bottle Rocket score is 100 pts.

#### Virtual Event - Calculation of WBR Score

There is no hangtime performance

The winner will be judged on the following criteria: (based on 100 pts):

*	Patch Design 20%

*	Technical Report 20%

*	Technical Drawing 20%

*	PowerPoint Presentation 20%

* The Art of Engineering 20%

<center>
![](images_MSHS/WBR_Patch.png){width=50%}
</center>

**Example Explanation of Patch**

The propelled rocket represents the school system, supported by educators and students, following a path towards excellence. The radiant five 8-point stars symbolize the enrichment of Science, Engineering, Communication, and Mathematics, whereas the seven 4-point stars represent the seven Universities that founded SECME. The three distinct contrails STEMing behind the rocket symbolize the support offered by SECME, Universities, and Industry partners. The ring before the rocket depicts a student’s path through the SECME program, returning full circle to support the program’s efforts. As we have entered the new millennium, the sun over the horizon symbolizes the induction of the new Water bottle rocket Design Competition into the SECME Programs. Accuracy, the contest’s focus, represents the target created by the outer ring, deep space, and the earth. The border is supported on the left and right by the water and compressed air symbols; the fluids used to propel the rockets.


## The Art of Engineering (AOE)

### The Art of Engineering Showcase

What is the Art of Engineering (AOE)? AOE is an opportunity for SECME student teams to showcase and discuss the design approach used for their  car, rocket, or robot. The AOE competition only takes place at National Competition Finals.

**New!** The AOE video presentation is a virtual only competition.

1.	This video presentation showcases the ART in the SECME student team engineering design of their  car, rocket, or robot.

2.	Each SECME student team will submit a five to seven-minute video on their  car, rocket, or robot from a creative, innovative, and artistic perspective.

In the video, teams will:

*	Introduce their team and themselves

*	Introduce their final design

*	Walk through their design process
      + Brainstorming design ideas – initial sketches and ideas
      + Prototype Versions – at least two versions
          - What each prototype looked like (image or drawing)
          -	What changes were made from each version
      +	Final Design
          -	Technical drawing and image
          - What changes were made from the last prototype
          - Why this design is your final design

Every student team member must contribute to a piece of the video to get all possible points. Be interactive and engaging in your presentation.

7. How does my SECME team determine the cost of 3D printing? 

    For 3D printing, the SECME student team evaluates the cost of the material used to make the part for their vehicle. 

    Example: Polylactic acid (PLA) pellets can be purchased for the price of $10.00 per 1 kg. If the SECME student team only used 1 g, the following calculation they would need to do to determine the cost of their 3D component:

    <center>
$\frac{10.00}{1 kg}×1 g×\frac{1 kg}{1000 g}=0.01$
    Cost = $0.01
    </center>

    The following is a link to how much 3D materials will cost in 2020:
    
    https://all3dp.com/2/how-much-do-3d-printer-materials-cost/

8. How does my SECME team log their purchases on their material list?

    Example: Balloons were purchased for $10.99 for 100 balloons. If the SECME student team only used two balloons, the following will be the calculation they would need to do to determine the cost:
    
    <center>
    $\frac{10.99}{100 ballons}×2 balloons=0.22$ 

    $0.22 for two balloons
